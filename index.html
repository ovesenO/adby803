                    Hello! My latest project, aka Orb Collector is a game about a spaceship that
                    has its life purpose of collecting orbs and avoiding asteroids! <br><br><br><br>

                    You move around by pressing Keys on the keyboards that are chosen randomly!
                    There is a GUI based on JLabels that shows the player which buttons to press
                    in order to move left or right!<br><br>

                    There are two save-files that the player can use, the reason for this is I felt
                    like creating a GUI using the Java GUI system allowing multiple save files would
                    create much sphagetti code, this system is nostalgic as it reminds me of the way
                    memory cards work in old PS2 Consoles! <br><br><br>

                    I learned a lot while working on this project! Including things such as using Interfaces
                    as a state-machine for GUI system, Using singleton pattern for game-states, and more! <br><br><br><br>

                    All in all I feel like this project has been a success because I learn a lot! Feel free
                    to view my other project, Rain in a box below! Thanks and have fun!

                <p>
                    I Programmed for 3 years prior to the BOOTCAMP - the first two years are in python and the last one is in Java. 
                    I like video games... A lot. I live in a different time zone so I wake up at 4 30 am to attend classes in city.
                    This geographic distance also makes it hard to play games in both EU(160 ping) & NA(89 ping) servers but at a lower elo I can manage.  </p>
    
                <p style="padding-top: 2cm;">
                    Concluding the two weeks of coding bootcamp this project demonstrates understanding in :
                  
                </p>
    
                <p>classes{}, 
                    Methods();, 
                    Loopsâˆž, 
                    Arrays[], 
                    and coordinates</p>
                <p>
                <p style="padding-top: 2cm;">
                    I faced two primary issues when coding my "Rain In A Box" program, the first of which is the fact that I could not use the box(); method as my main cube because processing would not render and geometry within a geometry. So one cannot see a sphere(); that is inside a box(); even if the box(); is transparent.
    The second problem I faced was syncing the Rain to the box' position in a way so that no matter the size & position of the box - the rain would still have full coverage within the box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I solved the first problem by creating my box method which only gives me what I need - which is 8 positions in space and lines drawn between them accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The second problem is solved through the intuitive use of a global variable called offset, this variable is equal to the cubes width, length & height.
