                I Programmed for 3 years prior to the BOOTCAMP - the first two years are in python and the last one is in Java. 
                I like video games... A lot. I live in a different time zone so I wake up at 4 30 am to attend classes in city.
                This geographic distance also makes it hard to play games in both EU(160 ping) & NA(89 ping) servers but at a lower elo I can manage.  </p>

                Concluding the two weeks of coding bootcamp this project demonstrates understanding in :

            <p>classes{}, 
                Methods();, 
                Loopsâˆž, 
                Arrays[], 
                and coordinates</p>

                I faced two primary issues when coding my "Rain In A Box" program, the first of which is the fact that I could not use the box(); method as my main cube because processing would not render and geometry within a geometry. So one cannot see a sphere(); that is inside a box(); even if the box(); is transparent.
The second problem I faced was syncing the Rain to the box' position in a way so that no matter the size & position of the box - the rain would still have full coverage within the box.
            </p>
            <p>
                I solved the first problem by creating my box method which only gives me what I need - which is 8 positions in space and lines drawn between them accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second problem is solved through the intuitive use of a global variable called offset, this variable is equal to the cubes width, length & height.
